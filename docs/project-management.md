# Project Management Model

## Working Groups

1. Spec WG
2. iOS WG
3. Android WG
4. Security WG
5. Growth WG

## Cadence

- Weekly triage: issues and PR backlog.
- Biweekly planning: roadmap and milestones.
- Monthly release checkpoint.
- Monthly launch and adoption review.

## Labels

- `spec`: `ChartSpec` model/schema/migration work
- `ios`: SwiftUI/SwiftData package work
- `android`: Compose/Room package work
- `security`: vulnerabilities and hardening
- `release`: versioning, changelog, artifacts
- `growth`: adoption, docs marketing, community feedback

## Ownership Rules

- Every issue must have one owner.
- Every milestone must have an exit checklist.
- Security issues are prioritized over feature work.
- Every release must include an adoption task (launch post, docs update, or example demo).
